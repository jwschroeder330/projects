    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "### Exercises\n",
    "You will perform a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions **in this notebook below and submit to your Github account**. \n",
    "\n",
    "   1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?\n",
    "   2. What are the null and alternate hypotheses?\n",
    "   3. Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value.\n",
    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "Note the p-value measures instances where the average callbacks for blacks met or exceeded callbacks for the comparison sample (population and whites, respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "When compared to the population (the dataset containing both races), we reject the null hypothesis that blacks are treated the same given the remarkably low p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This rejection is further validated when the comparison is made directly to whites. The p-value is so small that it fails to register. \n",
    "\n",
    "These assertions are both made with a very small (1%) margin of error and relative high confidence (95%).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What This Means\n",
    "\n",
    "It is clear that black-sounding names receive significantly fewer callbacks for job openings than white-sounding names. The analysis provides statistical backing for the assertion that racism is still alive and well when it comes to employment. Whites are more likely to get callbacks, and therefore are granted an advantage when it comes to career opportunites.\n"

    "\n",
    "While this analysis strongly suggests race is a factor in callback success, whether or not it is the most important factor is left to further investigation. The reason for this amibguity is because there are many other factors (education, experience, military) that may also play a role.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis needs to be ammended to include a Pearson correlation coefficient between the various factors and callback success. These factors would be broken down into \"background\" and \"opportunity\" since different backgrounds may lend themselves to more success for particular type of opportunity (for example, perhaps education plays a larger role in banking/real estate, but military background lends itself well to service and manufacturing jobs).\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis could be broken down by race, and a two-sample t-test could again be utilized. This way, we could see not only what the most important factors are, but if these factors have greater or less impact depending on race (for example, does education not contribute to success as much for blacks as it does for whites when applying for the same job type?)."
